=>  - Create an open loop Buck Converter using LTSpice with including paramTask1.txt as its parameters.
    - Create python code for plotting LTSpice simulation by using its data.csv, and that data.csv is BuckConverter.csv which the result of the simulation
      of our Open loop buck converter.

# 12-06-25
=>  - I'm trying to use PLECS instead of LTSpice as PLECS provides a lot things such transfer function block, PI Controller, etc which
      LTSpice doesn't have it (in LTSpice I have to build those things by myself so i prefer to use PLECS).

# 13-06-25
=>  - Successfully running the open loop buck converter simulation in PLECS.
    - I think i will change my python code to file.ipynb as it helps me lots in visualizing the plot.
    - Successfully create file.ipynb
    - I decide to reorganize files into folders
